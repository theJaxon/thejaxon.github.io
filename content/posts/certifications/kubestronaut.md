To become a [Kubestronaut](https://www.cncf.io/training/kubestronaut/), one must pass all the 5 Kubernetes related certifications.
For me, the original plan wasn't about becoming a Kubestronaut.

---

### Original plan
1. Give CKAD a try since i've never took that exam before.
2. Renew the already expired CKA/CKS certifications and go through the new updates.

The following is the timeline where I did the certifications starting with CKAD.
1. ✅ CKAD  => 04/02/2024
2. ✅ CKA   => 18/02/2024
3. ❌ CKS   => 10/11/2024 (Failed unfortunately and had to re-take it, I went through some lessons learned in my [CKS Exam V1.31 blog post](https://thejaxon.github.io/posts/certifications/cks_exam/))
4. ✅ CKS   => 24/11/2024

#### CKAD
- In the past I was already preparing for CKAD but never attempted it, you can see the [notes written here](https://github.com/theJaxon/CKAD).
- I've used the book **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer: In-depth Guidance and Practice by Benjamin Muschko** as my main source to prepare for that exam and that was enough for me to get a proper idea and go for it.

#### CKA
- For the CKA it was a recertification so I was confident, I just needed to refresh my knowledge and for that I read the book [**Acing the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam by Chad M. Crowell**](https://www.manning.com/books/acing-the-certified-kubernetes-administrator-exam)

#### CKS
- Sometimes confidence can be good, sometimes, it's just overconfidence and that was definitely the case, after failing that one on the first attempt, I had to adjust and study more.
- I went for [Killer shell CKS exam simulator](https://killer.sh/cks) which is a solid one.

### Do it because, why not ? 🧑‍🚀
Since the practical and challenging exams had already been passed, the question to me became, why not give it a go ?
What remained were KCNA and KCSA, both are MCQ exams and with some effort to prepare, you should be good to go (Although one must say that KCSA is definitely on the harder side).

And so I did, just prepared and went for it

5. ✅ KCNA  => 30/11/2024
6. ✅ KCSA  => 02/12/2024
