To become a [Kubestronaut](https://www.cncf.io/training/kubestronaut/), one must pass all the 5 Kubernetes related certifications.
For me, the original plan wasn't about becoming a Kubestronaut.

---

### Original plan
1. Give CKAD a try since i've never took that exam before.
2. Renew the already expired CKA/CKS certifications and go through the new updates.

The following isas the timeline where I did the certifications starting with CKAD.
1. ✅ CKAD  => 04/02/2024
2. ✅ CKA   => 18/02/2024
3. ❌ CKS   => 10/11/2024 (Failed unfortunately and had to re-take it, I went through some lessons learned in my [CKS Exam V1.31 blog post](https://thejaxon.github.io/posts/certifications/cks_exam/))
4. ✅ CKS   => 24/11/2024

### Do it because, why not ? 🧑‍🚀
Since the practical and challenging exams had already been passed, the question to me became, why not give it a go ?
What remained were KCNA and KCSA, both are MCQ exams and with some effort to prepare, you should be good to go (Although one must say that KCSA is definitely on the harder side).

And so I did, just prepared and went for it

5. ✅ KCNA  => 30/11/2024
6. ✅ KCSA  => 02/12/2024
