I wanted to renew my expired CKS certification. After some studying, I decided to just go for it.

My first attempt was on `Sunday, November 10, 2024, at 10:30 PM`, and it ended in catastrophic failure. However, I've also learned some lessons from it.

#### 1. Time is everything
I scheduled the exam at a late time, I know here I'm overstating the obvious but honestly I just underestimated the exam.

It's not an easy one and It's very time consuming, you will need every minute because you're only given **2 hours** to solve **16 performance-based tasks**, that's not a lot of time at all and my first attempt resulted in me not having enough time to go through 4 of these questions.

#### 2. Reiterate over the new exam objectives
Since I was previously CKS certified, I just assumed there wouldnâ€™t be significant changes. Boy, was I wrong!

The exam changed a lot and that was a surprise for me (Not a good one when you're taking the exam) so better check the new objectives, here i'm listing the weakness points for me on the first attempt:
  1. Implement Pod-to-Pod encryption using Cilium
  2. Understand your supply chain (e.g. SBOM, CI/CD, artifact repositories)
  3. Use appropriate pod security standards

#### 3. Use exam simulators
You can use the provided CKS exam simulator at [killer.sh](https://killer.sh/dashboard) as a way of validation, personally I didn't invest heavily in it, I just wanted to have a feeling of the exam environment once more as i was preparing for my 2nd attempt.

#### 4. Reschedule ASAP
My second attempt was on `Sunday, November 24, 2024, at 8:30 AM` , I tried to reschedule it earlier but there should also be some room to reiterate over why the first attempt was a failure.

Regardless It was done in the same month and thankfully the goal was accomplished.
